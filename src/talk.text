Thank you all for joinging me today to talk about service workers! 

My name is Victoria. I work for a web company called Cloudflare. Over 2 years now which in startup land makes me Cloudflare artifact
but not really an artifact. After time as a support engineer, I just started as a developer for the Cloudflare Apps platform recently

Let's talk about workers. What can workers do you us as a JS developer to make your site / web app / life better?What better way to demostrate this than to give some solid 
examples. I will break down the high level basics of what a worker is and then go over some examples of how to use them

What are workers ? Workers run away from your browser window's javascript to intercept requests and control the response 
to that request however one wishes. This interception can happen when your back end server is on or offline
This opens a window of possiblities from optimizing caching to push notifications

Where exactly is this code living and running? First, let's understand that Service Workers is a modern browser supported API that does run in your browser's 
tab, but on a seperate background thread. Even if you close the tab that initated the worker, the worker can still run. Web workers can also live on proxy 
servers such as Cloudflare or maybe other service like when eventually  AWS catches up  Lamdba on the Edge. In the proxy worker case, the script can run on 
multiple data centers. This is similarity to a service worker in that the script isn't running on the window's thread, but now the worker can intercept ANY request
not requiring browser support or even at a browser at all. There are more subtle differences but i won't get too into that now and will save the specifics for 
Q&A.

Ok, let's get into the good stuff. What can workers actually DO? Service workers can help us with caching. Let's take a look at a really basic example.
Setup an install listener to preCache right when the SW is installed
SW has a built in event called installed. Note this is not true for all web workers like Cloudflare workers.
